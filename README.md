To test the Prolog assignment included in this repository, you can use SWISH, an online Prolog interpreter.
---
For testing you can simply access the SWISH webpage (https://swish.swi-prolog.org/), press "Create a (Program)", copy the Prolog code from the relevant assignment file, and paste it into the text editor provided on the site. Scroll to the query prompt (?-) at the bottom, where you can input test queries for the functions or predicates, such as ?- predicate_name(arguments) or just type "go." so the program will call a main function, then press Enter or click "Run!" to execute. The output will display below the query prompt, allowing you to test the assignment.
